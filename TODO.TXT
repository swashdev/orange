TODO file for Orange Guy's Quest version 1.1

 - Refine the code further so that redundant work isn't being done.
 - Find out why the program hates my global variables so much.
 - Find a better system for displaying messages (some commented-out messages
   appear in the source code but have been erased from the level data--I'm
   thinking about adding a message box up in the corner)
