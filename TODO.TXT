TODO file for Orange Guy's Quest version 1.3

 - Refine the code further so that redundant work isn't being done.
 - Find out why the program hates my global variables so much.  (It might be
   because the global variables are being declared before the function
   declares them, but I'm not sure what Python expects me to do about it)
 - Figure out a way to scale up the display for people with larger screens
