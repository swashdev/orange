VERSION 1.002:

 - One of the doors in level 6 now opens diagonally in order to preserve the
   original challenge of the level.
 - Finishing the last level no longer raises a SystemExit; no further
   revisions to the code should use a SystemExit for anything other than a
   bug kill.
 - Ending the mainloop now displays a "quit message" (with the exception of
   end-of-games caused by a SystemExit).

Changes between Orange Guy's Quest version 1.0 and 1.1:

 - WINDOWS option added to allow users to define whether they want to use a
   backslash for their system.
 - Image sprites are now loaded into memory rather than being loaded once for
   every single time they are needed.
 - Image sprites are not loaded if they are not needed (user chooses the
   'Ancient' graphics setting)
 - The game no longer attempts to randomize enemy sprites, as they were not
   randomized in the final version of 1.0 and they are not randomized now.
 - The game no longer ends with an Index Exception.
 - Removed some of the attrocious final levels.
 - The location of the secret exit can no longer be discovered by observing
   where the player's sprite is clipped by it.
 - The game now has a semi-proper ending involving finding a sword.
 - Resetting the level no longer causes the level to reset several times.
 - Dying no longer kills the game immediately.  Instead the player is
   displayed having "died."
 - Level 2, the first level where the player is likely to fall in a hole, now
   instructs the player to use the BACKSPACE key to restart the level.
 - Replaced the hideous font with a marginally less hideous font.
 - Moved level storage into a plaintext file.
 - LEVELFILE option added to allow users to direct the program to their own
   customized level file.
 - The doors in level 6 now open vertically upward, not at angles.
 - extraLevels.txt restored to original functionality as a storage file for
   extra levels not part of the final game.
 - Added command line options.  See README.TXT.
 - Added BIGPLAYER option to restore player hitbox to the original 16x16 square
   from way back before 1.0 even had sprites.
 - Images are now loaded on-the-fly as they are needed; the first time a
   sprite appears in the game it is loaded into memory.
 - New images for keys with proper transparency handling; old key sprites have
   been preserved so that Version 1.0 displays them properly.
